# Kennesaw State University IT Captone: Phishing Training App for an LMS

These first for for the KSU IT Capstone group 7 project. We developed the application using the react js Framework via the software Articulate 360. The first .zip is the package that can be imported directly into a Learning Management System of your choice (The LMS used for this proejct is SCORM Cloud). The second .zip can be imported into KSU's Brightspace D2L. Phishing Training Update.story is the Articulate story files for any future editing of the application.
